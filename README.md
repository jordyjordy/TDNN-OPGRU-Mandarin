# TDNN-OPGRU-Mandarin
This is a repository that contains the results and code for  the paper "Evaluation of phoneme recognition throughTDNN-OPGRU on Mandarin speech"

This code is designed to be used by the Kaldi framework. 

Before use the cmd.sh and path.sh files should be changed to match the environment on your computer.

The base preparation code in the magic_data and magic_data_no_tones folders was supplied by Mihail Chirosca.

The lexicon used for magic_data was made by using the `local/prepare_dict.sh`  script and using the lexicon that this generates.
